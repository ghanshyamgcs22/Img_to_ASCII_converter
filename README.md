# ASCII Image Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts an image to ASCII art. It uses a set of ASCII characters to represent different intensity levels of the image pixels.

The ASCII Image Converter is a Python script that converts images into ASCII art. ASCII art is a form of digital art that uses characters from the ASCII standard to create images. This script takes an input image file, converts it into grayscale, and then maps each pixel to a corresponding ASCII character based on its intensity.

## Features

- Converts images to ASCII art with customizable character sets and output size.
- Supports various image formats, including JPG, PNG, and BMP.
- Ability to specify the output size of the ASCII art.
- Option to write the ASCII art to a text file for further use or display.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`Pillow`).
3. Run the script `ascii.ipynb`.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the path to the image file.
5. After conversion, the ASCII art will be saved to a text file named `ascii_image.txt`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (install via `pip install Pillow`)

## Example

Here's an example of ASCII art generated by the converter:
